    <p>I am someone who is genuinely passionate about coding and technology. I enjoy solving problems, building new things, and exploring how software works behind the scenes. Learning different programming languages and creating projects excites me because it allows me to turn ideas into real, working applications. Every time I write code, I feel motivated to improve, learn more, and push myself to create something better than before. Coding is not just a skill for me—it’s something I truly enjoy and want to grow with every day.
